** Goal


Define the role (i.e. expectations, responsibilities, rights, ...) for PhD students and their Post-Doc supervisors,
highlight the critical skills and good traits to develop:

skills: computing, writing, reading, presenting, 
underlying skills: zooming (know when to take a detailed or a higher level view).
traits: independence, initiative, 

and provide resourses to achieve those goals


** Key skills to develop 
Being able to synthesise papers/concepts/ideas/... to their esssence. This enables:
- recognising related problems, so you can take inspiration from what other people have done
- recognise limittions/weaknesses of your own methods, opening up new research problems
- comunicate your ideas. A paper and a research proposal need to be sold!

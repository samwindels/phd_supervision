# Scientific writing

## General

### Who is the audience

#### Computer scientists
- Computational contributions 
  * new algorithms
  * faster algorithms
  * new heuristics
#### Biologists
- Want to solve a biologial research question
- output (of bioinformatics) is a hypothesis. e.g. gene predictions


### Motivation 
- What is the biologial problem/research question
  For us, these are typically in the realm of precision medecine: 
  * drug reporposing
  * patient stratification
  * biomarker discovery
- Why is AI needed
  Because omics/medial data is big data: cannot be analysed/interpreted by practitioners anymore
- What computational problems will be solved (i.e. methodological contribution)
  For instance:
  * a new model, include new data
  * new way of extracting knowledge

# Towards a better PhD 

## Audience

PhD students and their post-doc supervisors

## Goal


Define the role (i.e. expectations, responsibilities, rights, ...) for PhD students and their Post-Doc supervisors,
highlight the critical skills and good traits to develop:

skills: computing, writing, reading, presenting, 
underlying skills: zooming (know when to take a detailed or a higher level view).
traits: independence, initiative, 

and provide resourses to achieve those goals


problem -> underlying cause -> suggested fix (i.e. design methodology) -> evaluate (has problem been fixed).

observation -> infer, i.e. what does it mean -> is further validation needed -> design experiment -> evaluate

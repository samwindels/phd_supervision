* Response to the reviewers

After submitting a manuscript to a journal, the editor sends the manuscript
to qualified researchers for review. Based on this review, the editor decides
to either publish the article, reject it, or request a revision. A request
for a revision of the manuscript, be it either 'major' or 'minor', does imply
that the editor is convinced of the potential merit of the article, despite
it requiring more work. Hence, the editor will likely accept the article
after fixing the reviewers' comments, although this process may take multiple
rounds.

Revising a manuscript means addressing all of the reviewers' issues in the
manuscript. Additionally, a response letter to the reviewers needs to be
written. The aim of this document is to convince the reviewers that all of
their considerations have been met. Note that this is a formal document.
Again the editor forwards the updated manuscript and response letter to
the reviewers and bases his decision on their responses.

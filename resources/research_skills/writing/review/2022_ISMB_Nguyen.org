* Paper summary

Knowing what protein-targets drugs can bind to is essential for drug
discovery and repurposing. As experimental assays to determine the
binding affinity of drugs to proteins are prohibitively expensive,
computational methods to predict drug-target interactions (DTIs) are
gaining attraction. Predicting DTIs for a given drug based on its
known DTIs generally leads to poor predictive performance for novel
drugs, for which not many DTIs are known (known in the literature as
the cold-start problem). Therefore, in this paper, the authors suggest
a new pipeline to predict DTIs that fuses chemical-chemical
interaction data, chemical structure data, protein-protein interaction
data and protein structure data to increase the predictive performance
for predicting DTIs for novel drugs.

* General evaluation

Although the method appears sound (section 3), the methodological and
biological contributions of this paper are unclear as a consequence of
the poor quality of the writing, which is generally speaking very
vague.

* Major issues

** The comparison to the state-of-the art is unclear

In tables 3-6, the authors compare their framework to the state-of-the
art in different variations of DTI prediction tasks. Of the listed
methods, it is unclear to me which one is actually theirs. I would
suggest the authors add an extra column to these tables, indicating
the corresponding model. It is also unclear what it means for scores
in these tables to be highlighted in bold.

Additionally, after reading the discussion of these tables (section
5.1), it is not clear to me what model is the best performing.

** The methodological contribution is unclear

One of the main contributions indicated is the integration of chemical
structure data and protein structure data. However, this paper is not the
first to do so (e.g., [2]). Hence, the authors should be more clear
about the methodological contributions in this paper.

** Many things are vaguely defined

For instance:
- The 'cold start problem' is defined as 'predicting DTIs for novel
drugs'. From this definition, it is not clear what the cold start
problem is, i.e, predicting DTIs for drugs with few or no known DTIs.

  
** Many things are not defined

For instance:
- How big is the training set, validation set, test set?
- The 'PDBBind' dataset is mentioned but never defined. At the same time, the 'Kiba' dataset is referenced but never used.
- Although it can be inferred what they are, the 'cold-drug setting' and 'cold-target setting' are not defined.


* Minor issues

** There are many grammar mistakes in this paper

For instance:
- Our contribution is two folds.
- With the graph-based drug encoder, PPI enhanced models has better overall performance.
- We hypothesise that not only the experimental interaction but also other types of interaction are useful for the pre-training task.
- The result of druggability classification on NRDLD dataset using ESM and ESM-PPI features ... 
- Conclusions and future works.
  
** The datasets used to evaluate the DTI prediction accuracy are quite old

The datasets used to evaluate the DTI prediction accuracy stem from 2011 and 2014.
I would suggest to consider the newer datasets, for instance [1].

** Section 5.3 could be placed in the supplement

Section 5.3, which evaluates if chemical-chemical interactions
should also include text co-occurence based 'interactions', 
adds little value and could be placed in a supplement.

** The authors offer little biological insight into their results

The authors show that some learned gene and drug representations serve
better than others as input vectors to a DTI predictor. It would be
nice if some biological insight could be provided into why some
methods work better than others.

** The word 'Pre-training' is used wrongfully

'Pre-training' in the context of machine learning refers to the case
where the model is first trained on a related dataset, typically when
lacking data. For instance, say one wants to build a classifier
detecting cats in pictures but only has few pictures of cats. In that
case, the model could be pre-trained on a larger dataset to recognise
dogs in pictures, and learn from the smaller dataset of cat pictures
subsequently. So, the same model is trained twice, but on different
datasets.

Here, the authors use 'pre-training' as terminology for learning features
which serve as an input for a DTI predictor. This is not the same
thing as above, as here, two separate models are trained (one to learn
latent representations of drugs, one to predict DTI's).


* Conclusion

Due to the quality of writing the contributions of are unclear. Hence,
I have to reject this paper.

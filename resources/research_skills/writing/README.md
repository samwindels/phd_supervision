# Scientific writing

## General

### Who is the audience

### What is the goal

#### Computer scientists
- Computational contributions 
  * new algorithms
  * faster algorithms
  * new heuristics
#### Biologists
- Want to solve a biologial research question
- output (of bioinformatics) is a hypothesis. e.g. gene predictions


### Motivation 
- What is the biologial problem/research question
  For us, these are typically in the realm of precision medecine: 
  * drug reporposing
  * patient stratification
  * biomarker discovery
- Why is AI needed
  Because omics/medial data is big data: cannot be analysed/interpreted by practitioners anymore
- What computational problems will be solved (i.e. methodological contribution)
  For instance:
  * a new model, include new data
  * new way of extracting knowledge



## Project roposal

### motivation

Think big. Rather than methodological inovation, go for a new paradigm.

## Biomedical paper

## Paper review (for journal submission)

if minor revisions: also focus on typos and small detail. if major revision, don't focus too much on it as it will have to be rewritten anyway. 

##  Literature review

## Response letter to review

It is a formal letter. The aim is to convice the reviewer that their issues are resolved. 

In the case of requested additonal experiments. If possible, include them in the discussion as potential future work. 
This document should be self contained, i.e. the reviewer should not have to reopen the manuscript. For instance, when fixign a typo:

This typo was removed from the manuscript. The complete sentence now reads: “...”.

#+TITLE: Reading


** Bibliography management tools

Bibliography management tools are used to manage your 
references/citations, article PDFs and notes.

It is suggested you have a single bibliography containing all of
your references. That way, any corrections you make to your references
persist across your projects.

*Suggested tools:*
- [[https://www.mendeley.com][Mendeley]] (crossplatform, GUI, has a web-browser citation import plugin)
- [[https://github.com/papis/papis][Papis]] (command line tool)


** Key Journals

Key journals to follow. Usually journals provide an email alert system of RSS feed.
Some RSS readers (e.g., [[https://github.com/sp1ff/elfeed-score/][elfeed]]) allow you to automatically rank entries based on the occurence of key-words to sift through the cruft.

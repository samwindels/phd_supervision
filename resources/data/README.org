* Data

In this directory, you can find an overview of biological data. If available,
scripts for processing the data into networks are provided in the scripts directory.

Most importantly, use the provided scripts as a starting point. The
scripts are not guaranteed to be bug-free (yet), so any bugs are your responsibility when using these scripts. As a PhD student, when you use these scripts, you are expected to understand what each line of code does and, crucially, what your network represents (e.g., what do the edges represent, what are the assumptions made).  Lastly, if you do find a bug, please fix them in this repository.

To anyone adding scripts, please update the table below and, in the
scripts, add a description of what the script does, the version number
of the database it has been tested on and your name (so we know who to
contact if something is not clear).
